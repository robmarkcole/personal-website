It is wonderful to see that the EO space is finally big enough for independent consultants that don’t have to sell you on their companies’ products.\nSebastian Gutierrez, Data Science Weekly: We reached out to Dr. Cole with a set of questions we thought he could answer and provide guidance upon. He over-delivered on the value he provided not only during our live chats but also with material for us to read through (before and after our chat). He compared different approaches without ‘putting his thumb on the scale’ and ultimately I think we were able to chose the right solution for us all due to his advice. 10/10, would highly recommend."
